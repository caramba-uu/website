I earned my Ph.D. in environmental chemistry from Stockholm University in 2016. Thereafter I spent two years as a postdoctoral researcher at University of California, Berkeley. Much of my research efforts in the CARAMBA research group has focused on the development of mass spectrometry methods for applications within metabolomics, lipidomics, and exposomics. In my main current project, funded by Formas, I explore the importance of internal and external environmental exposures for developing fibromyalgia."
