abstract = "This review focuses on post sampling changes and how the Stabilizor system has been used to control this natural biological process and potential implications on cancer-specific biomarkers due to post sampling changes. Tissue sampling is a major traumatic event that can have drastic effects within a very short timeframe at the molecular level [1] resulting in loss of sample quality due to post-mortem changes. A heat-stabilization technology, using the Stabilizor system, has been developed to quickly and permanently abolish the enzymatic activity that causes these changes post-sampling and so preserve sample quality. The Stabilizor system has been shown to give better sample quality when analyzing a variety of tissues in various proteomic workflows. In this paper we discuss the impact of using heat-stabilized tissue in different proteomic applications. Based on our observations regarding the overlap between commonly changing proteins and proteins found to change post-mortem we also highlight a group of proteins of particular interest in cancer studies."
