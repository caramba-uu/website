abstract = "Little is known about the inflammatory milieu in the blood during autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) and how it is affected by the stem cell mobilization, collection, and reinfusion and conditioning regimen. In this study, we analyzed 92 proteins connected to inflammation at 10 time points during and after AHSCT in 16 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Serum from 29 patients with newly diagnosed MS and 15 healthy controls were included for comparative analysis. There were no significant differences in inflammatory serum protein levels between patients with newly diagnosed MS and healthy controls, but 29 out of 73 detectable proteins were significantly altered between at least 2 adjacent sampling time points during AHSCT. The predominant changes occurred after the conditioning regimen had been administered, whereas stem cell mobilization, collection, and reinfusion appeared to have less impact. Two distinct response patterns could be discerned, likely representing loss of basal cytokine production and homeostasis. The analyzed serum proteins gradually returned to baseline levels after treatment, with no remaining differences at 3 months after AHSCT. We conclude that treatment with AHSCT has a major but transient impact on the inflammatory milieu of peripheral blood."
