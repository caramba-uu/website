abstract = "To increase our understanding of age-related diseases affecting the central nervous system (CNS) it is important to understand the molecular processes of biological ageing. Metabolomics of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a promising methodology to increase our understanding of naturally occurring processes of ageing of the brain and CNS that could be reflected in CSF. In the present study the CSF metabolomes of healthy subjects aged 30-74 years (n = 23) were studied using liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS), and investigated in relation to age. Ten metabolites were identified with high confidence as significantly associated with ageing, eight with increasing levels with ageing: isoleucine, acetylcarnitine, pipecolate, methionine, glutarylcarnitine, 5-hydroxytryptophan, ketoleucine, and hippurate; and two decreasing with ageing: methylthioadenosine and 3-methyladenine. To our knowledge, this is the first time the CSF metabolomes of healthy subjects are assessed in relation to ageing. The present study contributes to the field of ageing metabolomics by presenting a number of metabolites present in CSF with potential relevance for ageing and the results motivate further studies."
