abstract = "Chronic diseases affecting the central nervous system (CNS) like Alzheimers or Parkinsons disease typically develop with advanced chronological age. Yet, aging at the metabolic level has been explored only sporadically in humans using biofluids in close proximity to the CNS such as the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We have used an untargeted liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) based metabolomics approach to measure the levels of metabolites in the CSF of non-neurological control subjects in the age of 20 up to 74. Using a random forest-based feature selection strategy, we extracted 69 features that were strongly related to age (pageu2009<u20090.001, rageu2009=u20090.762, R2Boruta ageu2009=u20090.764). Combining an in-house library of known substances with in silico chemical classification and functional semantic annotation we successfully assigned putative annotations to 59 out of the 69 CSF metabolites. We found alterations in metabolites related to the Cytochrome P450 system, perturbations in the tryptophan and kynurenine pathways, metabolites associated with cellular energy (NAD+, ADP), mitochondrial and ribosomal metabolisms, neurological dysfunction, and an increase of adverse microbial metabolites. Taken together our results point at a key role for metabolites found in CSF related to the Cytochrome P450 system as most often associated with metabolic aging."
