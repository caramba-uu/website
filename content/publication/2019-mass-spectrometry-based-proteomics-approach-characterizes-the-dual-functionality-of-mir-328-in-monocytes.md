abstract = "MicroRNAs (miRs) are small noncoding RNAs which control the expression of target genes by either translational repression or RNA degradation, known as canonical miR functions. The recent discovery that miR-328 has a noncanonical function and can activate gene expression by antagonizing the activity of heterogeneous ribonuclear protein E2 (hnRNP E2) opens an unexplored and exciting field of gene expression regulation. The global importance of such noncanonical miR function is not yet known. In order to achieve a better understanding of the new miR activity, we performed a compartment specific tandem mass tag (TMT)-based proteomic analysis in differentiated MonoMac6 (MM6) cells, to monitor gene expression variations in response to miR-328 knockdown. We identified a broad spectrum of novel potential miR-328/hnRNP E2 and miR-328 targets involved in regulation of compartment specific cellular processes, such as inflammation or RNA splicing. This study provides first insights of the global significance of noncanonical miR function."
