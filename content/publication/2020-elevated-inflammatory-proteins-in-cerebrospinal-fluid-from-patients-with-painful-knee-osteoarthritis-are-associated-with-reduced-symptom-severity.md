abstract = "Neuroinflammation and periphery-to-CNS neuroimmune cross-talk in patients with painful knee osteoarthritis (OA) are poorly understood. We utilized proximity extension assay to measure the level of 91 inflammatory proteins in CSF and serum from OA patients and controls. The patients had elevated levels of 48 proteins in CSF indicating neuroinflammation. Ten proteins were correlated between CSF and serum and potentially involved in periphery-to-CNS neuroimmune cross-talk. Seven CSF proteins, all with previously reported neuroprotective effects, were associated with lower pain intensity and milder knee-related symptoms. Our findings indicate that neuroinflammation in OA could be protective and associated with less severe symptoms."
