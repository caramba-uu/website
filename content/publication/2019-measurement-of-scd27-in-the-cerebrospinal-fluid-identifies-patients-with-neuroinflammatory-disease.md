abstract = "BACKGROUND: Laboratory tests to assist in the diagnosis and monitoring of neuroinflammatory diseases are scarce. The soluble form of the CD27 molecule (sCD27) is shed in high concentrations by activated T cells and can be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. The aim of this study was to investigate whether CSF quantitation of sCD27 could discriminate between inflammatory and non-inflammatory neurological diseases. METHODS: The concentration of sCD27 was measured using a commercially available ELISA in 803 well-defined subjects from a study cohort comprised of 338 patients with neuroinflammatory disease, 338 with non-inflammatory neurological disease and 127 controls without neurological disease. RESULTS: The median value of cerebrospinal fluid sCD27 was 64u202fpg/mL (IQR 0-200) in controls, 58u202fpg/mL (IQR 0-130) in patients with non-inflammatory disease and 740u202fpg/mL (IQR 230-1800) in patients with inflammatory disease. The likelihood ratio of having an inflammatory disease was 10 (sensitivity 74% and specificity 93%) if the sCD27 concentration was >250u202fpg/mL. In patients with a known inflammatory condition, the likelihood ratio of having an infection was 10 (sensitivity 40% and specificity 96%) if the sCD27 concentration was >2500u202fpg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood of having an inflammatory neurological condition is increased with elevated concentrations of sCD27 in cerebrospinal fluid. Rapid tests of sCD27 should be developed to assist clinicians in diagnosis of neuroinflammatory disease."
