abstract = "We have compared the brain proteome in the temporal neocortex between Alzheimers disease (AD) patients and non-AD individuals by using shotgun mass spectrometry based on a stable isotope dimethyl labeling. A total of 827 unique proteins were identified and quantitated. Of these, 227 proteins were found in at least 9 out of 10 AD/control pairs and were further subjected to statistical analysis. A total of 69 proteins showed different levels (p-value < 0.05) in AD versus control brain samples. Of these proteins, 37 were increased and 32 were decreased as compared to the non-AD subjects. Twenty-three proteins comprise novel proteins that have not previously been reported as related to AD, e.g., neuronal-specific septin-3, septin-2, septin-5, dihydropteridine reductase, and clathrin heavy chain 1. The proteins with altered levels in the AD brain represent a wide variety of pathways suggested to be involved in the disease pathogenesis, including energy metabolism, glycolysis, oxidative stress, apoptosis, signal transduction, and synaptic functioning. Apart from leading to new insights into the molecular mechanisms in AD, the findings provide us with possible novel candidates for future diagnostic and prognostic disease markers."
