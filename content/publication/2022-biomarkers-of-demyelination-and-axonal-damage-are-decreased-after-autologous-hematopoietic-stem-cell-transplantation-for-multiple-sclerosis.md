abstract = "BACKGROUND: Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT) has seen increased use for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in recent years. It is considered one of the most effective treatments for RRMS and has been associated with improvement in disability and prolonged remission. This suggests that the tissue-injuring disease process may have been altered by aHSCT. To assess whether this hypothesis is correct, we performed a study of three commonly used cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of tissue damage. METHODS: In this single center study, 63 patients treated with aHSCT at Uppsala University Hospital between January 1st 2012 and January 31st 2019 were screened for participation. A control group consisting of volunteers without neurologic disease were included as a reference. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of neurofilament light (NFL), myelin basic protein (MBP) and glial acidic fibrillary protein (GFAp) were determined using ELISA and a multiplex proteomics platform from Meso Scale Discovery. RESULTS: Forty-three patients with a mean age of 31 and a median follow-up time of 3.9 years were included. Their median baseline expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score was 3.5 and the annualized relapse rate in the year preceding aHSCT was 1.6. At baseline the proportion of patients with values above the upper limit of normal was 67% for NFL, 63% for MBP and 16% for GFAp. At 5-year follow-up, the proportion of patients with values above the upper limit of normal was 12% for NFL, 12% for MBP and 25% for GFAp. The mean concentration of NFL decreased from 920xa0pg/mL at baseline to 270xa0pg/mL at 5-year follow-up (pxa0<xa00.001); MBP decreased from 1500 to 680xa0pg/mL (pxa0<xa00.001); whereas the mean concentration of GFAp was unchanged. CONCLUSION: In a majority of patients, biomarkers of demyelination and axonal damage reached normal values within five years from treatment with aHSCT."
