abstract = "Metabolomics encompasses the systematic identification and quantification of all metabolic products in the human body. This field could provide clinicians with novel sets of diagnostic biomarkers for disease states in addition to quantifying treatment response to medications at an individualized level. This literature review aims to highlight the technology underpinning metabolic profiling, identify potential applications of metabolomics in clinical practice, and discuss the translational challenges that the field faces. We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE for primary and secondary research articles regarding clinical applications of metabolomics. Metabolic profiling can be performed using mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance-based techniques using a variety of biological samples. This is carried out in vivo or in vitro following careful sample collection, preparation, and analysis. The potential clinical applications constitute disruptive innovations in their respective specialities, particularly oncology and metabolic medicine. Outstanding issues currently preventing widespread clinical use are scalability of data interpretation, standardization of sample handling practice, and e-infrastructure. Routine utilization of metabolomics at a patient and population level will constitute an integral part of future healthcare provision."
